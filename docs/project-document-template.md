2. Key Questions
3. Hypothesis: Overview of how it could be done
4. Impact


### A. Problem Statement: 

_In as direct terms as possible, provide the “Data Science” problem statement version of the overview. Think of this as 
translating the above into a more technical definition to execute on._


### B. Checklist for project completion

 project._



1. Deliverable 1

### C. Provide a solution in terms of human actions to confirm if the task is within the scope of automation through AI. 

_To assist in outlining the steps needed to achieve our final goal, outline the AI-less process that we are trying to 
automate with Machine Learning. Provide as much detail as possible._


### D. Outline a path to operationalization.

_AI Ops Projects should have an operationalized end point in mind from the onset. Briefly describe how you see the tool
 produced by this project being used by the end user beyond a jupyter notebook or POC. If possible, be specific and
