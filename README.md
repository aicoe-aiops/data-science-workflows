## Start Here: AI Ops DS Project


Please use the following outline to get started with a new AI Ops Data Science Project:


1. Review the project workflow document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LqVXQbd81IdPfoXw2B0iCcnb-ygCVvdy_8vejY08zZ4/edit).

2. Create a new description using this [template doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CIFlKiVbNX3CKC-tD7kVDkP1S8eDfDEibdLM6jgIj2g/edit). See example [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1prfyxHAQq60IU_K_f-eTNVCB6FKV2q00YAbmY-jI_HE/edit).

3. Put the doc into a subfolder of this [shared directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17nhASQZUbGISFQswUb-ft3V1dxbD7dtX). 

4. Copy this [project board](https://github.com/orgs/aicoe-aiops/projects/2) to a new organization level project board including automation. See [Copying a project board](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/copying-a-project-board).

5. Request a Ceph bucket [here](https://help.datahub.redhat.com/docs/onboarding-to-ceph-s3) and add your data to it. (Must be connected to the VPN)

6. Create a [CookieCutter](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/#cookiecutter-data-science) formatted data science project from this [template repo](https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/project-template). Follow these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) to create a new repo from this template.

7. Create a private [GitHub repo](https://github.com/orgs/aicoe-aiops) in this org.

## GitHub workflow

1. Create an issue for every task you plan to work on.
1. Add the issue to the *New* column of the corresponding project board.
1. Let somebody from the team review the issue and refine it, until it's clear what should be done and what defines done.
   1. Provide some sort of acceptance criteria.
   1. Break the issue into smaller issues if it can't be done in one sprint.
1. Move the issue to the *To Do* column.
1. Once you start work on the issue move to the *In Progress* column and assign it to yourself.
1. Create a PR for the issue and reference the issue in the PR description.
1. Let somebody from the team review the PR - never merge your own PRs.
